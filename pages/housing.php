<p>Housing remains a big problem for many students, but we hope we can help a little bit!</p>

<h2>Student Accommodation from the University</h2>
<p>If you are student at the university, either permanant or exchange, the university has an offer of accomodations available. This should be your first place to look. You can find all the info about this on the <a href="" class="external">uni.lu website here</a></p>
